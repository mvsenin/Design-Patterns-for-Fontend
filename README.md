# Design Patterns for Fontend
Please find a few demo projects with several design patterns for frontend. Please note all projects are based on Nodejs, so you'll need to have node & npm on your machine, also don't forget to install the dependencies for each project from the package.json by calling **npm install** command in the project's folder.

Below you can see the list (to be updated per demo prepatation and readiness) of demos for the design patterns grouped as follows:

#  Creational patterns

> Creational patterns abstracts object instantiation process, given this the system becomes independent of the details how objects are created, composed, and represented.

| Pattern name | Variable aspects | Scenarios |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| 1. Singleton  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />| The sole instance of a class  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />| Global logger service <br /> Global state data <br /> Hardware interface access <br /> Managing Shared Resources (Cache) <br /> Service Classes, Configuration File |

# Structural patterns

| Pattern name | Variable aspects | Scenarios |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| 1. Facade    | Functionality in one or more subsystems | It is often present in systems that are built around a multi-layer architecture |

# Behavioral patterns

Good luck.
